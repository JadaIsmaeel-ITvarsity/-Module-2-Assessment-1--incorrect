                          <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3> 
                        <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.</p>
                        <p>An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5 cm (1 in) thick on the back and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, anus, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants are typically grey, but African elephants look brown or reddish after rolling in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the head. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, with the head and back being particularly hairy</p>
                        <p>African savannah elephants are the largest elephant species. The biggest male African savannah elephants can weigh up to 6,800 kilograms (15,000 pounds). For comparison, an average male human weighs about 82 kilograms (180 pounds). 

On the other hand, Borneo elephants are the smallest elephant subspecies. Adult male Borneo elephants can weigh as little as 2,950 kilograms (6,600 pounds). </p>
